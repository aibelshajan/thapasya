            Refund Policy
            Request for Refunds
            If you have made an error in donating or change your mind about contributing to our organization, we will honor your request for a refund within seven business days of your gift.
            Mode of Refund
            Refunds are returned using the original method of payment. If you donated by credit card, your refund will be credited to that same credit card. If payment was made by cheque, the refund will be issued via bank transfer or account credit.
            Failed Transactions
            In case of failed online transactions, which result in no donation, we offer our users the facility to re-attempt donating.
            Non-refundable Donations
            Donations to Thapasya Kala Sahitya Vedi are treated as gifts and are generally non-refundable. However, we understand that there can be exceptional circumstances where a refund is necessary.
            Approval of Refunds
            Upon receipt of a written request for a refund, we will review it for approval. If approved, the refund will be processed within ten business days.
            Tax Exemption Conditions
            Please note that if you have taken a tax exemption under section 80G of the Income Tax Act in India, your donation is not eligible for a refund. The tax exemption is provided to encourage donors to contribute to charitable causes. If a refund is issued, you must declare this, which could potentially alter your tax liability.
